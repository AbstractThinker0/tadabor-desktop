## Disclaimer

The app is in beta, which means you may encounter occasional bugs. We strongly recommend keeping a backup of any data you save while using the app. Your data is stored locally on your machine and is never transmitted or stored on a remote database. However, it's always a good practice to have a backup. Please be aware that the accuracy of the Quran roots/stems list has not been verified, and the completeness of search results based on sentences/roots has not been extensively tested.

## Known bugs

- The Linux/Mac version lacks auto-update functionality, unlike its Windows counterpart. As a result, users must uninstall the application and manually download the latest version from the releases page.

## TODO List

- Add more searching methods (Tashkeel, multiple Surahs search... etc.). (Partially implemented)
- Add a settings menu that allows the users to choose font size/colors... etc.
- Add unit tests or similar to make sure that everything works as expected.
- Revamp the interface for a better user experience (Also implement a Dark theme switch).
- Document code and improve readability when possible.
- Document all the features and how they can be used.

- Node.js
- npm

Once you have satisfied the prerequisites, you can install and start the application. Clone the app, and from its directory run:

2. `npm run start`

## Future project:

Once all features of this project are implemented, it will serve as the foundation for another project that aims to create a platform for collaborative translation and reflection upon the Quran. The ultimate goal is to achieve an accurate understanding of the true message of the Quran by undoing all the semantic changes that have occurred over the centuries. There is currently no set deadline, and it all depends on God's will.
